# whats this 
I made quickly some malware, inspired by the run box captcha scams, but better. targets avast users that have gotten rid of windows defender, should work on AVG antivirus too if code is changed to look for AVG not Avast. None of the .html files were coded by me, roblox pages found online and index.html made by AI. /dl/launcher.exe is just a bat file thats converted to exe, nothing special there, doesnt matter since for some reason avast detects it and deletes it, but doesnt affect ability to infect victim
